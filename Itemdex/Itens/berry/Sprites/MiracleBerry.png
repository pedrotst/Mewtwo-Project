<p>The first of the special daily challenges is now live. This challenge is Meowth's Coin Mania and will be playable every Saturday and Sunday for the next 3 weeks. In it, you need to match up various coins which gives you a boost in your coin total. This is running until Monday at 06:00 UTC and can only be played once per day. In addition to that, when you check in, you will receive 1 Jewel as an apology for a glitch that existed in the game on Thursday</p></div>

The game is a small 686 blocks to download. That's approximately 85MB<br />
01:12: Starts off with a tutorial. The capture chance is based upon the amount of turns you have left at the end of the stage<br />
01:21: When catching Eevee in Stage 5, it's guaranteed to fail to give a Great Ball demonstration<br />
01:24: You get given a gem to replenish your hearts to 5. The timer always stops at 5 so you can't reaccumulate hearts overnight to get massive amounts / In-game pricing structure has changed a little to how it was in the first trailer<br />

5 Hearts = 1 Gem<br />
18 Hearts = 3 Gems<br />
38 Hearts = 6 Gems<br />
80 Hearts = 12 Gems<br />

3000 Coins = 1 Gem<br />
10000 Coins = 3 Gems<br />

01:36: Mega Evolution is shown by beating Stage 10<br />
01:42: There's a special event involving Mew live until 15:00 JST on March 9th. A special option just opened up for it.<br />
01:45: Beating Stage 12 unlocked the Extra courses 1, 2 & 3 featuring Absol, Rotom and Lucario. These are timed rather than turn-based<br />
02:00: Pricing scheme: 
1 Gem = 100&yen;<br  />
6 Gems (5+1) = 500&yen;<br  />
12 Gems (9+3) = 950&yen;<br  />
35 Gems (25+10) = 2500&yen;<br  />
75 Gems (48+27) = 4800&yen;<br  />
<br  />
It also never lets you spend more than 10,000&yen; a day<br />
Edit @ 02:07: New Events Announced. Meowth stage will run every Saturday and Sundayfrom February 21st to March 21st. It can be challenged once every 24 hours. You can get coins by  clearing the coins on the touch screen. In addition to this, from February 23rd to March 21st, Rotom events can be obtained.

<p class="title">Pokémon Shuffle</p>
<p>The official site has posted that in Japan, the Nintend 3DS title, Pokémon Shuffle, is to be released on Wednesday February 18th. This title is a free to play game with mechanics akin to Pokémon Battle Trozei and requires just 100MB to run. This matches a date given for the United States earlier this week. There is also confirmation that gems will cost 100&yen; a gem. Gems can then be exchanged for coins to buy items, or hearts to ignore the cooldown period<br />
Edit @ 05:22: Some more mechanics have been revealed. This game doesn't just have you automatically capture the Pokémon, but rather you either catch or defeat it. The Pokémon have a health bar and as it goes down, you are more likely to be able to capture a Pokémon with a PokéBall, just like the main games. However, you also can use a Great Ball, purchased with coins, which has a higher probability of capture. <br />
05:28: There are also bonus stages which remove the move limit for you, but instead give you a time limit on how fast you need to clear the Pokémon. There are at least 18 of these stages and they feature Pokémon like Lucario, Charizard and Xerneas<br />
Edit @ 05:43: There also appears to only be 159 Pokémon to obtain in this game, and over 40 different abilities between the various Pokémon.<br />
Edit @ 11:55: We have obtained a few dozen high quality pre-release screenshot images for the game and have added them to our <a href="/shuffle/pics.shtml"><u>Pre-Release Screenshot Page</u></a><br />
Edit @ 05:31: A new trailer has also been posted<table align="center" class="dextab" width="425">

Edit @ 18:55: With the official posting on the official site, some confusion has arisen regarding the end date.

<p>Today marks the sixty-fifth entry into the Generation VI competitive field with a Kalos Pokémon. These entries are created by the visitors for the visitors and then compiled by our writers Miror, Archangel, jesusfreak94, Ragnarok, KillerDraco, KingTorterra  & UR2L8. To get involved, <a href="http://www.serebiiforums.com/forumdisplay.php?210-POTW-Collaboration" target="blank"><u><b>Click here for the discussion forum</b></u></a> <br />Today, we are covering a Pokémon introduced in the sixth generation.  When this legendary Pokémon's wings and tail feathers spread wide and glow red, it absorbs the life force of living creatures. When its life comes to an end, it absorbs the life energy of every living thing and turns into a cocoon once more. So here it is, the sixty-fifth entry, Yveltal.</p></div>
